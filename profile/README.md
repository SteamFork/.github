# SteamFork
SteamFork is a personal project to create an immutable Linux distribution that is as SteamOS like as possible without sacrificing device compatibility.

## Features
* Full SteamOS UI/UX, including desktop mode.
* Power management optimizations ported from [JustEnoughLinuxOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS).
* Improved fan curves on supported devices.
* RGB disabled by default on Ayaneo and Ayn devices.

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>1 </sup> Sponsored devices are fully supported by its maintainer.  Support for unsponsored devices may vary. <sup>2 </sup>New AMD based devices from Ayaneo do not support sleep due to an incorrect firmware setting.  This setting is locked down and must be enabled using a third party helper.  Follow the process from @ChimeraOS to enable sleep [ [here](https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Community-Guides#enabling-modern-sleep-on-7000-series-amd-hardware) ].

### Sponsorship
Sponsoring a device is a commitment to maintaining support for your device by validating, testing, and bugfixing any issues that may arise.  Adding support for a device's basic features is straight forward, however, it can become far more technical to add support for features such as fan control.  If you are interested in sponsoring your device, follow the process below.

1. Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.
2. Boot the SteamFork live image.
3. Create a device quirk using the quirk generator included.  Minimum requirements are gamescope resolution, and rotation if needed.
```
$ sudo -s
# steamfork_quirk_generator --help
```
4. Create a pull request to the [SteamFork Device Support](https://github.com/SteamFork/distribution/tree/main/PKGBUILD/steamfork-device-support) package with your new addition.
5. Open and take ownership of any issues specific to your device on the [SteamFork Bug Tracker](https://github.com/SteamFork/bugtracker).
6. When ready to begin sunsetting support for your device, generate and PR new quirk with the `--supported false` property.

### Installation
To install SteamFork, flash the bootable image to a USB device and then follow the procedure for your device to boot from removable media.  From the live mode desktop, open the "Install SteamFork" application and then follow the prompts to install to your device.  When complete, close the installer, and shut down the device.  Remove the installation media, and then power the device on to boot into SteamOS.

* SteamFork only supports systems with AMD APU/GPUs.
* Installation to removable media such as microsd and usb drive is not currently supported.

## Power Management / TDP Control
To enable management of the device TDP, switch to desktop mode and then install Decky Loader and Simple Decky TDP.

## Credits

Like any Linux distribution, this project is not the work of one person.  It is the work of many persons all over the world who have developed the open source bits without which this project could not exist.  Special thanks to Valve for providing SteamOS, HoloISO which this project is based upon, ShadowBlip, JELOS, ChimeraOS, and developers and contributors all across the open source community.

## Support
This distribution is made available for myself and others who may want to use it, however it is provided as-is.  Bug fix and feature PRs are always welcome.

## Sources
This project utilizes sources from SteamOS (release repositories), the unofficial Valve source repo, and AUR.
