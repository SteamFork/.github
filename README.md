## Credits

Like any Linux distribution, this project is not the work of one person.  It is the work of many persons all over the world who have developed the open source bits without which this project could not exist.  Special thanks to Valve for providing SteamOS, HoloISO which this project is based upon, JELOS, and to developers and contributors across the open source community.

## Support
This distribution is made available for myself and others who may want to use it, however it is provided as-is.  Bug fix and feature PRs are always welcome.
